Imagine a world where everyone, no matter where they live or how much they earn, can learn a new language through one-on-one conversations with native speakers.
Our project makes this vision a reality - breaking down financial barriers and giving everyone equal access to knowledge and opportunities.
All it takes is an Internet connection.


We believe that language should unite, not divide - and with AI, we are making this dream come true.
